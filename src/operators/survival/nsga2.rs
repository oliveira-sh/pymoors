        Test for survival selection with multiple fronts in NSGA-II (classic approach).

        Scenario:
          - Front 1 contains 2 individuals (first front, rank = 0). Since n_survive = 4,
            all individuals from Front 1 are selected.
          - Front 2 contains 4 individuals (second front, rank = 1), but only 2 more individuals
            are needed to reach a total of 4 survivors.

        Classical NSGA-II crowding distance calculation (for a single objective) assigns
        an infinite crowding distance to the extreme individuals (those with minimum and maximum fitness values).
        For Front 2 with fitness values:
             [0.3], [0.4], [0.5], [0.6]
        the extreme individuals (with fitness 0.3 and 0.6) get a crowding distance of infinity,
        while the interior ones get finite values.
        Hence, when selecting 2 individuals from Front 2, the algorithm should select the two extremes:
             - The individual with fitness [0.3] (index 0)
             - The individual with fitness [0.6] (index 3)

        Expected final population:
          - From Front 1 (all individuals): genes [[0.0, 1.0], [2.0, 3.0]] with fitness [[0.1], [0.2]]
          - From Front 2 (selected extremes): genes [[4.0, 5.0], [10.0, 11.0]] with fitness [[0.3], [0.6]]
